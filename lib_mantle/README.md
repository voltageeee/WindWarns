# Mantle
A helping GLua library for writing scripts in Gmod

## Opportunities
- Using custom VGUI
- Creating shadows in the interface via the "shadows" module
- Downloading the material from the link for its further use
- And much more in the future!

## Take a look at the UI
You can take a look at the visual capabilities of the library by looking at other works done on Mantle. But also log into the game and enter the `mantle_ui_test` command in the console
